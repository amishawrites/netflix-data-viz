# Netflix Data Visualization

This project showcases my first attempt at creating a dashboard using Tableau. I utilized the Netflix dataset sourced from Kaggle to analyze and visualize various aspects of the popular streaming platform.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) from Kaggle. It contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, including details such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and duration.

## Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard I created provides interactive visualizations to explore the Netflix dataset. It presents insights on different aspects, including the distribution of content by genre, country, and release year, as well as the top directors and actors on the platform. The dashboard aims to provide an intuitive and comprehensive overview of the Netflix content landscape.
